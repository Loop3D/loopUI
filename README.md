# uncertaintyIndicators

uncertaintyIndicators.py provides several functions to analyse the variability among an ensemble of voxets. It allows the computation of local measures of uncertainty (cardinality and entropy) and of global dissimilarity measures (e.g. based on multiple-point statistical analysis or wavelet decomposition among other possibilities).

Examples on how to use the functions are provided in a series of python notebooks. A pre-requisites to run the nbk-*.ipynb is to unzip models.zip in the working folder and then run example.ipynb to load an snsemble of voxets.
